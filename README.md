The reason for asking these questions and the topic I was trying to attack through this project was the topic of mental health and essentilaly this application and these questions were created for self reflection to take time and answer carefully to see where you placed yourself in a mental aspect on your life. However, this was the main goal for me due to the fact that this application is targeted more towards dtuent use and being a student anywhere is not easy. It comes with it's challenges all the time and people do struggle to find motivation to continue their lives. So, through this application I reach out to students through self reflection on their mental health by asking these simple yet effective questions!
